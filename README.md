# Barton Juggling

This is a place for me to refine my knowledge of juggling.

## Workspace -- Simple ideas in progress

* Review and write notes on [Juggling projects on github](./thoughts_and_notes/github_juggling_projects.md)
* Think about a web server that can take a video file, allow you to define a region of interest, then run a juggling tracker against it.
* Write notes on a python module which can act as a base for jugging programs going forward.
* Finish TODO items in [Config Writer README.md](https://github.com/bartonski/tfg_jugglingTrackingSiteswap/blob/config_writer/README.md)

## Discussion with myself

Thoughts, tidbits, resources to keep track of

### BXX with clubs

* Keep hands low
* Thow when the club reaches horizontal.
* **REALLY** try to keep throws vertical
* Stand next to a wall with bad hand away from the wall. This will force you not
to throw up/forward rather than out.
