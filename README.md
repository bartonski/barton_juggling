# Barton Juggling

This is a place for me to refine my knowledge of juggling.

## Workspace -- Simple ideas in progress

* Finish TODO items in [Config Writer README.md](https://github.com/bartonski/tfg_jugglingTrackingSiteswap/blob/config_writer/README.md)
* Review and write notes on [Stephen Meschke's ***Juggling***](https://github.com/smeschke/juggling)
* Think about a web server that can take a video file, allow you to define a region of interest, then run a juggling tracker against it.
* Write notes on a python module which can act as a base for jugging programs going forward.

## Discussion with myself

Thoughts, tidbits, resources to keep track of
