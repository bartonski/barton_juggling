# Barton Juggling

This is a place for me to refine my knowledge of juggling.

## Workspace -- Simple ideas in progress

* Finish TODO items in [Config Writer README.md](https://github.com/bartonski/tfg_jugglingTrackingSiteswap/blob/config_writer/README.md)
* Review and write notes on [Juggling projects on github](./thoughts_and_notes/github_juggling_projects.md)
* Think about a web server that can take a video file, allow you to define a region of interest, then run a juggling tracker against it.
* Write notes on a python module which can act as a base for jugging programs going forward.

## Discussion with myself

Thoughts, tidbits, resources to keep track of

* Ideas for juggling tracker:
    * an 'event' has a location in space and time.
    * an 'object' is something that exists in space and time -- a hand or prop.
    * a 'hand' is an object that manipulates props being juggled
    * a 'prop' is an object being juggled -- ball, club, ring, rubber chicken, etc.
    * a 'release' is the event where a prop is thrown
    * a 'catch' is the event where a prop is caught
    * a 'path' has an object and a sequence of events that describe the movement of the object.
    * a 'throw' is the path of a prop from release to catch.
    * a 'carry' is the path of a prop and hand from the point of catch to release
    * Therefore a prop is either in a state of 'throw' or a state of 'carry'

### BXX with clubs

* Keep hands low
* **REALLY** try to keep throws vertical
