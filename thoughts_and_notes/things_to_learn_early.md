# Things that I wish I knew earlier as a juggler

* Fear of dropping is the biggest mental hurdle to juggling
* Not paying attention to drops is the second biggest mental hurdle to juggling
* Learning to juggle involves physically rewiring the brain -- some neurons are coated with a layer of a protein called myelin, which speeds up the neural inpulses. This process takes some time, so you can't learn to juggle instantly.
* If you want to move fast, practice slow. Get the preparation, accuracy and timing correct before increasing speed.
* Focus, in order of importance:
    1. Rhythm / Tempo
    1. Consistency of throws and catches
        1. Know where everything is:
            1. Know exactly where the props are, all the time.
            1. Know exactly where your hands are, all the time.
            1. Know where you want the props to go, all the time.
            1. A drop is caused by a violation of one of the above. identify what you didn't know.
        1. Know your guide posts
            1. Know where 'vertical' is
            1. Wall plane / scoop
            1. Tray plane
                1. Throw and catch happen in the tray plane, meaning that the forearm is paralell to the floor.
                    1. Catching below the tray plane creates a little bit more time for corrections. This should be uncommon, but it's useful.
                    1. ***Do not catch above the tray plane.***
            1. Shoulder planes
            1. Throw and catch points
                1. These should fall on the line defined by the intersection of the tray plane and the wall plane.
            1. Tangent at the time of throw
                1. If you draw a right triangle with the base being the throw and catch points the height of the triangle is four times the height of a parabola with the equivalent throw angle.
            1. Throw ceiling
                1. Related to the square of the flight time
        1. Left and right hands must be the same
        1. Palm plane / Normal. Direction of the palm determines the direction of the ball
            * Throwing too early -- palms point forward, 'sprinting juggler syndrome'
            * Throwing too late -- palms point backward, throw over your head.
            * Think of the negative space between your hand and the prop as you're throwing.  In a cascade, the throw from the opposite hand will travel through that path. (idea: attach streamers to balls? With LEDs?)
            * The throw is a lift. There is a bit of 'trampoline' action as your hand opens, but even this should be smooth and controlled.
        1. Hands can be in a limited range of positions -- as far up and down as you can reach, as far left and right as you can reatch, as far forward and backward as you can reach. In order to be caught, a prop must pass through this space. Its path is a 'tube' through this space. Know where this tube is for each throw, and make the throw so that the 'catch tube' is in the most catchable place.
    1. Know where your elbows are at all times
    1. Preparation at the bottom of the scoop
    1. Point and lift toward the corner of the pattern
    1. Left / Right placement of catch
* Feel where your hands are as you make the scoop, and use this as a guide when
correcting throws.
* Juggle from your elbows -- think about your forearms and hands as props
  to be manipulated; the real juggling happens at the elbows. The elbows
  don't move much from left to right or back/forth but they do rotate to
  aim the forearms and hands.
* Throw to the position where you will catch the prop. This should be millimeter-precise. This means, in combination with 1), that you will know exactly where your hand, your wrist and your elbow should be when you catch the prop.
* A catch is a stall -- the prop decelerates smoothly rather than slapping your hand.
* The scoop is a preparation for the throw. The bottom of the scoop is half a beat after the catch, and half a beat before the throw.
* The scoop is a redirection of the energy of the previous throw -- rather than stopping the prop dead and then re-accelerating it. 
* 1 beat dwell time => N-1 beats air time puts throw and catch on the beat, which feels very natural.
* Learn how to break a hard trick into easier parts
* Your brain will learn what you practice.
    * If you practice bad technique, you will have bad technique.
* Practicing drops (dropping over and over while practicing) reenforces dropping -- don't do that.
    * Learn as much as you can from each drop
    * If you don't know why you dropped, that should tell you that you're not paying attention to something
    * If you're dropping too much, back up to an easier step and get it perfect
* Practice your juggling grip.
* Try varying scoop size?
* Pay attention to movements that feel rushed. Analyze what is causing the rush and fix it. You may:
    * Learn the feeling of a rush, and conciously 'un-rush'. Concentrate on good technique and smooth throws.
    * 'Polish' your throws -- make your movements regular and predictable
    * Increase the height of your throws
    * Increase your dwell ratio
    * Decrease the length of your scoop (catch closer to your throw position)
* When juggling clubs, you're juggling the center of gravity of the clubs.

## [Notes from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/juggling/comments/1iv573u/comment/me86l97/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Put two balls in your non-dominant hand, and work on making three throws until the pattern is just as solid as from your dominant hand.

Next hold two balls in your non-dominant hand, but pretend you're holding two in your dominant hand. Mime the first throw and count it as 'one'. Then make three throws (just as you did in the previous step). These will be throws 2, 3 and 4.

That will get you past the 'freeze because I don't know what happens next' feeling. Start back with two in your dominant hand, and make all four throws, and catch. There will be a tendency to fling the fourth throw out in front of you in a panic. If that happens, go back to starting with the non-dominant hand and practice until all three throws happen in exactly the same plane. Go through miming the first throw, keeping the other throws exactly the same.

You can use the same technique, miming out two throws then making three real throws when figuring out five throws. Once you get to five throws and five catches, moving up to six throws shouldn't be a huge streatch. Keeping things in a plane may be a challenge, just move back to the previous step and make sure that everything stays in the same plane. Keep adding throws.
